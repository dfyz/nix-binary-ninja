# Nix flake for Binary Ninja
This is an unofficial, experimental Nix flake for running Binary Ninja on NixOS.

More testing is needed; currently only `x86-64_linux` is tested, and only a bit.
Additionally, more variants (e.g. an FHS variant) might be desirable.

## Usage
1. Include the flake in you nix configuration
    ```nix
    binaryninja = {
        url = "github:jchv/nix-binary-ninja";
        inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
    ```
    - also include the flake input as an argument to your `outputs`
2. Include the installer in the nix-store, if not using the free version
    ```bash
    nix-store --add-fixed sha256 <path-to-installer>.zip
    ```
    - You can get a copy of the latest release using your registered e-mail address [here](https://binary.ninja/recover/).
3. Include the appropriate package edition from the [Packages section](#Packages) in your packages
    ```nix
	environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
		binaryninja.packages.${pkgs.system}.<package-attribute>
	];
    ```
    - replace `<package-attribute>` with your chosen edition

## Packages
The following package attributes are available:

- `binary-ninja-free`
- `binary-ninja-personal`
- `binary-ninja-commercial`
- `binary-ninja-enterprise`
- `binary-ninja-free-wayland`
- `binary-ninja-personal-wayland`
- `binary-ninja-commercial-wayland`
- `binary-ninja-enterprise-wayland`

For the free version, please see the License section.

For other versions, note that you will need to provide the latest installer.

The `-wayland` variants will force Binary Ninja to use the Wayland window
system. This comes with some caveats and is not recommended under Gnome. See the
[Binary Ninja troubleshooting section on Wayland](https://docs.binary.ninja/guide/troubleshooting.html#wayland)
for more information.
